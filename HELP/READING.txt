The program asks you whether you've taken a reading yet. Answering
"No" will not have any negative consequences. Instead, the program
informs you that you'll need to use your equipment to take a glucose
reading before you can progress, and then returns you to the "Have
you taken a reading?" screen.

Taking a glucose reading is a process that varies depending on what
equipment you typically use to monitor your blood sugar. Some common
methods are test strips or arm pods. Ask your doctor if you are not
sure how to take a glucose reading.

If you haven't taken your blood sugar reading prior to logging in,
you may either do so while the program waits, or log out and choose
to record the data at another time. The program won't time out.

Once you have a reading ready, click "Yes" (green). You will be
provided with a text entry box for a numerical value 0-999.

If you are typing and nothing happens, please click the text entry
box in the middle of the screen. It will change colors to a lighter
hue, indicating it is "active".

If you enter an invalid input, the program will prompt you to enter
a value between 0-999. Your invalid input will not be saved.

If you see red text below the entry box, please make sure you're
typing a valid number.

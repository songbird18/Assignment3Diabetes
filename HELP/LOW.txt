If your blood sugar is below the lower limit defined by your
doctor, the program will warn you and ask you to eat a sugary
food to help balance out your sugar.

You will not be required to enter your glucose a second time.
Simply click "Next" after replenishing your sugar, and you
will move on to the next stage of reporting. No further action
inside the software is necessary.
